### **Abeg, Abeg, Abeg... 😒**  

My name is **George**, but my friends call me **Nsima (NNN-SEA-MA)**. I'm a **Blockchain & Privacy-focused Software Developer**. I started tinkering with programming early in life, then went to university to study **Law**, but somehow ended up building **decentralized systems** and advocating for **privacy in crypto**.  

> I'm always looking for like-minded people who are passionate about **privacy tech, DeFi, and decentralization**. If you're down to build something experimental and disruptive, let’s connect!  

🔭 **Currently working on:** Privacy-enhanced blockchain projects, including Romenium.  
👯 **Looking for:** Collaborators interested in **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, privacy-preserving tech, and **Web3 dApps**.  
⚡ **Fun fact:** I spend most of my time thinking about **financial privacy**, breaking **centralized systems**, and building things to make surveillance obsolete.  

📫 **For collaborations, reach out via email:** georgensima [@] gmail [.DOT.] com
