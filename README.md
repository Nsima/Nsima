### **Abeg, Abeg, Abeg... 😒**

My name is **George**, but close friends call me **Nsima (NNN-SEA-MA)**. I’m a **Privacy-First Software Developer** who stumbled from a **Law degree** into a life of **breaking centralized systems**, building on-chain tools, and now — teaching machines to *be opinionated*.

> These days, I’m not just writing code for humans — I’m training AI to reflect human opinions.  
> Whether it’s **stealth transactions** or **neural networks**, I’m all about building systems that *respect privacy, think critically, and challenge surveillance norms*.

🔭 **Currently working on:**  
- Romenium: A privacy-enhanced blockchain token  
- *What Would My Pastor Say?* — an AI/ML project trained on real sermons.  
- A Prediction AI to control my browser and do things I would "most likely" do but more *efficiently*.

👯 **Looking for:**  
- Builders obsessed with **ZKPs**, **AI with moral frameworks**, or **decentralized cognition**  
- Collaborators ready to blend **crypto**, **machine learning**, and **security**

💡 **New obsession:**  
Teaching AI to give, human-centered opinion — without selling your data to the highest bidder.

⚡ **Fun fact:**  
If I’m not coding, I’m probably thinking about the meaning of life, decrypting something I encrypted myself, or feeding a neural net and asking it what love means.
